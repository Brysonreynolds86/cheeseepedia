<b>Fatz:</b>
<br>
Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to ShowBiz Pizza's tribute to the circus. I am your honorable massacre of ceremonies Reginald J. Fattican, but uh you can call me Fatz. On our way to the big top why don't we stop off on the midway and ride some rides.
<br><br>
<b>Dook: (Singing)</b>
<br>
Last night I took a walk after dark
<br>
A swingin' place called Palisades Park
<br>
To have some fun and see what I could see
<br>
That's where the girls are
<br>
I took a ride on a shoot-the-chute
<br>
That girl I sat beside was awful cute
<br>
And when we stopped I gave that girl a hug
<br>
My heart was flyin'
<br>
Up like a rocket ship
<br>
Down like a roller coaster
<br>
Back like a loop-the-loop
<br>
And around like a merry-go-round
<br>
We ate and ate at the hot dog stand
<br>
We danced around to a rockin' band
<br>
And when we quit I gave that girl a hug
<br>
In the tunnel of lo-hove
<br>
You'll never know how great a kiss can feel
<br>
Until you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel
<br>
Well we fell in love
<br>
Ah-
<br>
Down at Palisades Park
<br><br>
<b>All: (Singing)</b>
<br>
Run run runnin'
<br>
Now the ride the runnin'
<br><br>
<b>Dook: (Singing)</b>
<br>
Down at Palisades Park
<br><br>
<b>All: (Singing)</b>
<br>
Run run runnin'
<br>
Now the ride the runnin'
<br><br>
<b>Dook: (Singing)</b>
<br>
Down at Palisades-
<br><br>
<b>All:</b>
<br>
Woo!

<b>[Song: On a Carousel]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi Mozzarella: (Singing)</b>
<br>
Riding along on a carousel
<br>
Trying to catch up to you
<br>
Riding along on a carousel
<br>
Will I catch up to you?
<br>
Horses chasin', 'cause they're racin'
<br><br>
<b>All: (Singing)</b>
<br>
So near and so far
<br>
On a carousel
<br>
On a carousel
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi Mozzarella: (Singing)</b>
<br>
Nearer, nearer by changing horses
<br>
Still so far away
<br>
People fighting for their places
<br>
Just get in the way
<br>
Soon you'll leave and then I'll lose you
<br><br>
<b>All: (Singing)</b>
<br>
Still we're going 'round
<br>
On a carousel
<br>
On a carousel
<br>
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round with you
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi Mozzarella: (Singing)</b>
<br>
Up, down
<br><br>
<b>All: (Singing)</b>
<br>
 Up, down, up, down too
<br><br>
<b>[Song: Spinning Wheel]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear: (Singing)</b>
<br>
What goes up must come down
<br>
Spinnin' wheel got to go 'round
<br>
Talkin' 'bout your troubles, it's a cryin' sin
<br>
Ride a painted pony, let the spinnin' wheel spin
<br>
Did ya find the directing sign
<br>
On the straight and narrow highway?
<br>
Would you mind a reflecting sign?
<br>
Just let it shine within your mind
<br>
And show you the colors that are real
<br><br>

I knew that I just had to make you mine

But its so hard to talk to you

With fellas hangin' 'round with you all the time
<br>
I want you for my sweet pet
<br>
But you keep playing hard to get
<br>
I'm going around in circles all the time

<b>[Song: The Night the Carousel Burned Down]</b>
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear: (Singing)</b>
<br>
Weren't you there when the carousel burnt down?
<br>
The fire and confusion, the smoke and the sound
<br>
I swear you there when the carousel burnt down
<br>
We were all around
<br>
The rings charred and tarnished all over the ground
<br>
And our heads hung down
<br>
And we all left town
<br>
The next day
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear & Mitzi: (Singing)</b>
<br>
The children all cried when the carousel burnt down
<br>
The old ladies sighed when the carousel burnt down
<br>
The rest of us lied as the carousel burnt down
<br>
And the flames did fly
<br>
The pipes steamed and shrieked out a blazing goodbye
<br>
As the boiler died
<br>
And they melted down
<br>
The midway
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear: (Singing)</b>
<br>
And we all left town
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear & Mitzi: (Singing)</b>
<br>
The next day
<br>
And we all left town the next day
<br>
And we all left town
<br>
The next day
<br>
