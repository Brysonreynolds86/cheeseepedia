Wait a minute, Fatz how do you think you're gonna get in shape eating Twinkies and Ding Dongs and junk food?
<br><br>

<br>
Well I'm trainin' to be a sumo wrestler and that means I gotta get about double in size.
<br><br>

And Elvis Presley too
<br>
Don't you ever get smart with me boy
<br>
Or I might sit on you
<br><br>
<b>[Fatz laughs]</b>
<br><br>
I'll smash buses against buildings just walkin' down the street
<br>
I'll get stuck in every doorway and they'll have to blast me free
<br>
When I double in size
<br>
Double in size
<br>
Every single part of me will double in size
<br>
I triple in size
<br>
Then triple in size
<br>
Every single part of me will triple in size
<br>
Quadruple in size
<br>
Quadruple in size
<br>
And when you see me boys and girls you won't believe your eyes

[Song: Cover Me (Parody)]
<br><br>
<b>Beach Bear: (singing)</b>
<br>
The nights are tough yea

They're long and cold
<br>
I shiver and shake from my head down to my toes
<br>
Cover me
<br>
I'm begging for your mercy
<br>
Cover me
<br>
I gotta sleep with little brother
<br>
And he always pulls the covers off of me
<br>
So cover me
<br>
Every night I freeze to death
<br>
Every night I suffer and its
<br>
All because my goofy little brother
<br>
Cover me
<br>
I'm turnin' blue now cover me
<br>
I gotta sleep with little brother
<br>
And he always pulls the covers off of me
<br>
Cover me
<br>
I gotta sleep with little brother
<br>
And he always pulls the covers off of me
<br>
Ah please I'm turnin' blue
<br>
I gotta sleep with little brother
<br>
And he always pulls the covers off of me
