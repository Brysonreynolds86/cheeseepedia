**Chuck E. Cheese:**
Well hello everybody! You're just in time for our tv show!

**Mr. Munch & Jasper T. Jowls & Helen Henny & Pasqually:**
What?

**Helen Henny:** 
Is there something you haven't told us Chuck E?

**Jasper T. Jowls:**
Where are the cameras?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**
Nah gang, I just thought it would be fun to bring back some of the great musical themes from everybody's favorite old tv shows!

**Pasqually:**
That sounds great Chuck E! What are we going to cook up first?

**Mr. Munch:**
It better be pizza, or I'm outta here.

**Helen Henny:** 
Oh Munch, you're such an animal

**Chuck E. Cheese:**
Great place to start Helen! Animals were the stars of lots of tv shows! Here's 2 I'll bet you'll remember, take it Jasper!

**[Song: Mr. Edd Theme]**

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**
A horse is a horse, or course, of course
And no one can talk to a horse, of course
that is, of course, unless the horse is the famous Mr. Edd

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**
I am Mr. Edd

**[Song: Flipper Theme]**

**All: (Singing)**
They call him Flipper, Flipper, faster than lightning
No one you see, is smarter than he!
And we know Flipper lives in a world full of wonder
Flying there under, under the sea!

**Helen Henny:**
Ba-caww. Hey chuck E how about a romantic tv adventure, like you-know-who who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor?

**Mr. Munch:**
And fed the hungry!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**
Let's try these 2 adventure themes! The second doesn't have lyrics, but it certainly has "star" quality.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**
Is that a hint?

**[‘The Adventures of Robin Hood’ theme]**

Robin Hood, Robin Hood, riding through the glenn
Robin Hood, Robin Hood, with his band of men
Feared by the bad
Loved by the good
Robin Hood

Robin Hood

You mean actors of the canine persuasion? I think I remember.

**[Song: The Ballad of Jed Clampett]**

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed
Then one day, he was shooting at some food
And up through the ground come a bubbling crude
Oil that is, black gold, Texas tea

Forget about your cares, it is time to relax at the junction.

Green Acres is the place to be.
Farm livin' is the life for me.
Land spreadin' out so far and wide

Green Acres we are there!
