**Chuck E. Cheese:**
Well hello everybody! You're just in time for our tv show!

**Mr. Munch & Jasper T. Jowls & Helen Henny & Pasqually:**
What?

**Helen Henny:** 
Is there something you haven't told us Chuck E?

**Jasper T. Jowls:**
Where are the cameras?

**Chuck E. Cheese:**
Nah gang, I just thought it would be fun to bring back some of the great musical themes from everybody's favorite old tv shows!

**Pasqually:**
That sounds great Chuck E! What are we going to cook up first?

**Mr. Munch:**
It better be pizza, or I'm outta here.

**Helen Henny:** 
Oh Munch, you're such an animal

**Chuck E. Cheese:**
Great place to start Helen! Animals were the stars of lots of tv shows! Here's 2 I'll bet you'll remember, take it Jasper!

**[Song: Mr. Edd Theme]**

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**
A horse is a horse, or course, of course
And no one can talk to a horse, of course
that is, of course, unless the horse is the famous Mr. Edd

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**
I am Mr. Edd

**[Song: Flipper Theme]**

**All: (Singing)**
They call him Flipper, Flipper, faster than lightning
No one you see, is smarter than he!
And we know Flipper lives in a world full of wonder
Flying there under, under the sea!

**Helen Henny:**
Ba-caww. Hey chuck E how about a romantic tv adventure, like you-know-who who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor?

**Mr. Munch:**
And fed the hungry!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**
Let's try these 2 adventure themes! The second doesn't have lyrics, but it certainly has "star" quality.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**
Is that a hint?

**[‘The Adventures of Robin Hood’ theme]**

**Pasqually:**
Robin Hood, Robin Hood, riding through the glenn
Robin Hood, Robin Hood, with his band of men
Feared by the bad
Loved by the good
Robin Hood
Robin Hood 
Robin Hood

**[Helen sings the theme of "Star Trek"]**

**Pasqually:**
Nice operatic soprano Helen! It was a hint Jasper. The real "stars" of that show were Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock in, Star Trek!

**Jasper T. Jowls:**
How about some comedies Chuck E? There's lots of em!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**
There sure are Jasper! But just for you, let's remember 3 country comedies that had cousins of yours in, shall we say, supporting roles.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**
You mean actors of the canine persuasion? I think I remember.

**[Song: The Ballad of Jed Clampett]**

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**
Come and listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed
Poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed
Then one day, he was shooting at some food
And up through the ground come a bubbling crude
Oil that is, black gold, Texas tea

**[Song: 'Petticoat Junction' theme]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**
Come ride the little train that is rolling down the tracks to the junction.
Forget about your cares, it is time to relax at the junction.

**The Warblettes: (Singing)**
Petticoat Junction

**[Song: ‘Green Acres’ theme]**

**Pasqually: (Singing)**
Green Acres is the place to be.
Farm livin' is the life for me.
Land spreadin' out so far and wide

**Pasqually & Helen Henny & The Warblettes: (Singing)**
Green Acres we are there!

**Pasqually:**
I bet everybody remembers this one, snap your fingers twice.

**[2 finger snaps]**

**Pasqually:**
Again.

**[2 finger snaps]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**
Keep it up gang! That'll get us into 3 more fabulous comedies from the 60's


**[Song: ‘The Addams Family’ theme]**

**All: (Singing)**
They're creepy and they're kooky
Mysterious and spooky
They're all together ooky
The Addams family
