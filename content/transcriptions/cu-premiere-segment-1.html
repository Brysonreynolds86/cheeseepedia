<br>
Where else can you do a half a million things<br>
All at a quarter to three
<br><br>
<b>Helen Henny: (singing)</b>
<br>
When they play their music<br>
Ooh their modern music<br>
They play it with a lot of style
<br><br>
<b>Mr. Munch: (singing)</b>
<br>
But it's still that same old back beat rhythm<br>
Really, really drives 'em wild<br>
Ha ha ha!
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating<br>
And from what I've seen I believe 'em

<b>Pasqually The Chef: (singing)</b>
<br>
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
