<b>Fatz: (w/ reverb)</b>
<br>
Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to ShowBiz Pizza, where we're payin' tribute to the greatest show on Earth. I am your aristocratic announcer Reginald Fatticanz, the massacre of ceremonies, but you can call me Fatz.
<br><br>
[Fatz Scoffs]
<br><br>
I would like to direct your attention, here to the center ring, where Mitzi will sing us a hit song from folk town- about the sad side of the circus, the sad tears of a clown.
<br><br>
[Song: Tears of a Clown]
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
<br>
Now if there's a smile up on my face
<br>
It's only there tryin' to fool the public
<br>
But when it comes down to foolin' you
<br>
Now, honey, that's quite a different subject
<br>
But don't let my glad expression
<br>
Give you the wrong impression
<br>
Really I'm sa-ad
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
Sad, sad, sad, sad
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
Oh, sadder than sad
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
I'm hurt so bad
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
You're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
I pretend, to be glad
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
Like a clown, I pretend to be glad
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
Sad, sad, sad, sad
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
Now there's some sad things known to man
<br>
But that ain't too much sadder than
<br>
The tears of a clown
<br>
When there's no one around
<br><br>
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
<br>
Now if I appear to be carefree
<br>
It's only to camouflage my sadness
<br>
In order to shield my pride, Iâ€™ve tried
<br>
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
<br>
But don't let my show convince you
<br>
That I've been happy since you
<br>
Decided to go
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
Why did you go?
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
Oh, I need you so
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
I need you so
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
I'm hurt and I want you to know
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
Want you to know
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
But for others I put on a show
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
It's just a show
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
Oo-hoo yea
<br>
Now there's some sad things known to man
<br>
But that ain't too much sadder than
<br>
The tears of a clown
<br>
When there's no one around
<br>
Oh yeah
<br>
Just like Pagliacci did
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
The great pretender
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
I try to keep my sadness hid
<br>
Smiling in the public eye
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
A great pretender
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
But in my lonely room, I cry
<br>
The tears of a clown
<br>
When there's no one around
<br>
Oh yeah, baby
<br>
Now if there's a smile on my face
<br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
Tears of a clown
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
Don't let my glad expression
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
Tears of a clown
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
Give you the wrong impression
<br>
Don't let this smile I wear
<br><br>
<b>All: (singing)</b>
<br>
Tears of a clown
<br><br>
<b>Mitzi: (singing)</b>
<br>
Make you think that I don't care
<br>
The tears of a clooown
