<br>
Thanks, Chuck E.! Y’know, we’re all new here, and it’s fun! But for me it’s also just a little bit scary trying to make new friends, so here’s a song that I hope will make us friends, right now!
<br><br>
<b>Helen Henny: (singing)</b>
<br>
Clock strikes upon the hour<br>
And the sun begins to fade<br>
Still enough time to figure out<br>
How to chase my blues away<br>
I've done alright up 'till now<br>
It's the light of day that shows me how<br>
And when the night falls, loneliness calls
<br><br>
<b>Helen and Backup: (singing)</b>
<br>
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody<br>
I wanna feel the heat with somebody<br>
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
