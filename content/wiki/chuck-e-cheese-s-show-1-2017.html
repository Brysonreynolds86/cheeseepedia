The puppets were all given new outfits based on their 90s designs with some changes from the original 89 designs such as. Chuck doesn't have a Derby, Helen has yellow hair, and Jasper has no hat.</li><li>In 'Remember That Time' the retro outfits are shown when they show an image taken 'at the very first Chuck E. Cheese's' despite the fact none of those outfits would be worn until 1989. They also photoshopped a Derby onto Chuck which came from an <a href="https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/rarely-seen-mint-1986-chuck-cheese-1810336063"> old Ebay Auction</a>. The second image is what was used in 'Remember That Time'.</li></ul>
