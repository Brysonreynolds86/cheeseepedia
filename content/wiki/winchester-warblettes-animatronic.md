### Production & Manufacturing

Before the bot was created, Harold Goldbrandsen created concept art showing what the bot could do. The concept art had scrapped movements for the eyes, heads, & hands.
The bot was developed in early 1977 by Harold Goldbrandsen & Fantasy Forest.

The bot was seen in an episode of the Australian broadcast series, 'Four Corners' in their 'New Eatery Fad' segment<sup>(1)</sup>.
