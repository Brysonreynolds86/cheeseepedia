<center>Welcome to Cheese-E-Pedia! This introduction article will help you get started with the basics to venture into our tons of articles.</center>
<br>
The <b><i>{{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}}</i></b> was an animatronic band created by {{< wiki-link "Creative Engineering" >}} for {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}} restaurants in August of 1980, which continued at its locations until 1992- where they were retrofitted with {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese's" >}} characters as the new {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}}. The Rock-afire also appeared at family entertainment centers starting in the late 80's, and continue to be at various centres to this day.
<h2>Characters / Animatronics</h2>
The RAE consisted of a large cast of animated characters which have mostly stayed the same for its entire run:
<ul>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Billy Bob" >}} - A brown country bear with a sweet disposition and the main mascot of the Rock-afire through both ShowBiz and the RAE's future outings. Is best friends with Looney Bird.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Looney Bird" >}} - A silly red bird that lives in an oil drum. Initially started as a goofy drunk, but slowly became a "tech nerd bird" with interests in various technologies.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Mitzi Mozzarella" >}} - A gray cheerleader mouse depicted usually as a stereotypical teen girl. She is the only canonical character to age, being born January 1, 1971.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Beach Bear" >}} - A white bear who likes to surf and be cool.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Fatz Geronimo" >}} - A keyboard-playing gorilla from the Audobon Zoo forming the centerpiece of the band and the leader of the Colander Head Movement. Is self-aggrandizing and a philanderer with "potentially" a wife named {{< wiki-link "Esmerelda" >}}. Canonically wrote the 1984 Louisiana World's Fair Theme, which was in real life created by Fatz first voice actor- Burt Wilson.<sup>(1)</sup></li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Dook Larue" >}} - A brown dog drummer with an affinity for space. Portrayed as dim-witted during skits, but with a powerful singing voice during songs.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Rolfe Dewolfe" >}} - A gray ventriloquist wolf, being a former K-Mart lounge singer- now manager of the band, performs various skits with Earl on their stage- or comes out to harass the main band. He is greedy and selfish, believing he has a large fanclub that inflates his ego.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Earl Schmerle" >}} - A yellow muppet-looking sidekick to Rolfe as his ventriloquist dummy. Earl uses every opportunity to antagonize and demean Rolfe as his foil. He is treated as a real individual character that lives with Rolfe, implying Rolfe's personality on-stage isn't just an act for the audience.</li>
</ul>
The RAE also had a few prop characters with minor roles, being {{< wiki-link "Choo-Choo" >}} the baby black bear, a {{< wiki-link "Sun" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Moon" >}}, and the spider {{< wiki-link "Antioch" >}}.
<br>
Additionally, Rolfe & Earl have been rotated out of the cast on occasion to bring in new guest characters, such as {{< wiki-link "Santa Claus" >}} and the {{< wiki-link "Statue of Liberty (Animatronic)" >}}, and notably big-nosed human {{< wiki-link "Uncle Klunk" >}}. Klunk, atleast in his ShowBiz debut, was a goofy personality calling up various characters to bounce off of, alongside his bird Murray. The initial Creative Engineering take by Jeff Howell, as originally intended for the character, presented more as an awkward talk-show host- with a bird named Click.
<h2>History</h2>
The Rock-afire Explosion, taking combined elements and characters from their prior {{< wiki-link "Wolf Pack 5" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Hard Luck Bears" >}} shows, debuted at the {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}} ShowBiz Pizza Place on August 14th, 1980. Early iterations of the show had varying animatronic mechs, masks, accessories, clothing, props, painted elements, and more- but this would be refined throughout the first 4 years. The band would be given a new showtape every few months to play, usually consisting between 30 minutes to an hour of songs and skits. Additionally, all shows had the {{< wiki-link "3-Birthday Reel" >}}, which allowed birthday segments to be queued up at any time.
<br>
The showtapes for the first few years were mainly compilations of various skits and segments all unrelated to eachother. Each tape would combine new segments with ones from previous tapes, giving titles like {{< wiki-link "RAE Classic Hits" >}}, {{< wiki-link "12 Shows Special" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Best of Rock-afire Explosion '82" >}} This would even culminate in test markets recieving a {{< wiki-link "Show Selector" >}} that let customers choose any skit in any order to play.
<br>
By July of 1981 the shows best segments would start making their way onto records with the first as {{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion Record 1 (1981)" >}}, which would continue for most of the RAE's life at ShowBiz. By 1982 the band would get a full LP with {{< wiki-link "Gee, Our 1st Album Vinyl Record (1982)" >}}. 1981 would also be start of Rock-afire themed merchandise, kicking off with a plush doll line of the main cast. Later on various hats, mugs, and pewter items would be for sale.
<br>
The first show to begin having segments extend into multiple parts would be {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza '82 Tape" >}} in Spring of 1982, having the "Feelings Skit", "Crying Skit", and "Satisfaction Medley" back to back. The {{< wiki-link "Spring Shows '82" >}} tape would then spread these across the runtime. {{< wiki-link "Tribute to Abbey Road" >}} would feature a much larger production with rented musicians, 3 original songs, children for backup vocals, and finishing with a 14-minute Abbey Road Medley. Mitzi would also be recast from Aaron Fechter, who played 5 other characters, to Shalisa Sloan, now having a proper female vocalist. 
<h3>Mid-80's</h3>
The first fully-themed tape would be {{< wiki-link "RAE Christmas '82" >}}, which now also featured Rick Bailey as Beach Bear, again replacing Aaron, and switching his early personality of a goofball to being more laid back. Later that month the first 'live' showtape would debut as {{< wiki-link "New Years Eve Countdown '82'" >}}, which was set to play once at a specific time at all ShowBiz Pizza Place's to coincide with the New Years countdown.
<br>
In March of 1983 the first major event for ShowBiz would commence, being the {{< wiki-link "Crazy Colander Head Night (Event)" >}}, pitched by Creative Engineering based on their own company in-jokes. It would encourage customers to wear crazily decorated colanders on their heads for Wednesday nights during the month. A full line of promotional material, an hour long employee-exclusive promo tape called the {{< wiki-link "Save The Colander Telethon (1983)" >}}, live show props, character costumes, showtapes, and more would be sent to stores. Both the birthday show and main show would be fitted entirely around the event, with multiple segments interjecting to dicsuss the event. A special show could also be called upon from the Birthday reel as the "Colander Indoctrination" every Wednesday night during the month. An employee would play a live character called 'Johhny D. Jockimo' that interacted directly with the cast.
<br>
Directly riding off the success of the event, July through September would feature {{< wiki-link "The Amazing Uncle Klunk Traveling Show (Event)" >}}, which had the 40 Uncle Klunks dispersed and moved around between various stores as a travelling show that replaced Rolfe & Earl temporarily. September through November would see another company-wide event called {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz's Fabulous Fall Festival (Event)" >}}, which featured new showtapes played on different nights of the week, a complete rerun of Crazy Colander Head Night, and a new set of promotional material to collect. The year would end off with Klunks now being dressed up as Santa and distributed to various stores for the {{< wiki-link "Santa On Stage Show 1983 (Event)" >}}.
<br>
After 1983 events would almost fully stop outside various infrequent uses of Klunk and the various other characters he would be retrofitted as. By this point the Rock-afire was now transitioning to fully themed showtapes which had various tiny plotlines interwoven between all the skits. 1984 would feature themes such as {{< wiki-link "Magic Night" >}}, {{< wiki-link "Trivia Night" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Country II" >}}.
<br>
Due to clashes between Creative Engineering and ShowBiz Pizza Place over various things, 1985-1987 featured barely any new show content, likely with stores running previous years shows in the interum. The only major changes would be the introduction of {{< wiki-link "Billy Bob Interactive Animation" >} in 1984, which allowed employees to control and voice Billy Bob for birthdays, the {{< wiki-link "Family Vision" >}} program in 1985, which had a projector display random videos during the breaks between showtape segments, and a similar concept of {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Programs" >}} by late 1986, which instead played just music. By 1987 ShowBiz Pizza would begin making their own set of shows in-house, featuring a whole new writing style and voice cast. These would continue the themed show idea, except now splitting shows into multiple parts- each with their own theme. These could then be reused to fill content of later tapes in the year.
<h3>Last Years With ShowBiz</h3>
By 1988 ShowBiz's would begin modifying their stages into the {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Campground" >}} theme, fit with new TVs for displaying showtape video- due to Creative Engineering beginning to license out the Rock-afire to other family entertainment centers. This would help distinguish their shows from the competition and keep up to date with advancing technology. FEC's were now recieving the Rock-afire's vast back-catalog, just with any references or skits pertaining to ShowBiz muted or cut.
<br>
The Rock-afire's original cast would return in '88 with a whole new wave of shows, generally considered as the {{< wiki-link "Cyberstar" >}} era- named after the new TV showtape program. Going forward these would adopt ShowBiz's multi-themed show standard, allowing various mash-ups of older content to be reused through the upcoming years. New content would slow down into the 90's, with the last new segment coming as the 'Olympics' segment for the {{< wiki-link "SPP Best Of 2" >}} show in December of 1990. The last ShowBiz show would be {{< wiki-link "SPP Best Of 5" >}}.
