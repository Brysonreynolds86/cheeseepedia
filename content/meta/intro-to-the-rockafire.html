<center>Welcome to Cheese-E-Pedia! This introduction article will help you get started with the basics to venture into our tons of articles.</center>
The <b><i>{{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}}</i></b> was an animatronic band created by {{< wiki-link "Creative Engineering" >}} for {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}} restaurants in August of 1980, which continued at its locations until 1992- where they were retrofitted with {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese's" >}} characters as the new {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}}. The Rock-afire also appeared at family entertainment centers starting in the late 80's, and continue to be at various centres to this day.
<h2>Characters / Animatronics</h2>
The RAE consisted of a large cast of animated characters which have mostly stayed the same for its entire run:
<ul>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Billy Bob" >}} - A brown country bear with a sweet disposition and the main mascot of the Rock-afire through both ShowBiz and the RAE's future outings. Is best friends with Looney Bird.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Looney Bird" >}} - A silly red bird that lives in an oil drum. Initially started as a goofy drunk, but slowly became a "tech nerd bird" with interests in various technologies.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Mitzi Mozzarella" >}} - A gray cheerleader mouse depicted usually as a stereotypical teen girl. She is the only canonical character to age, being born January 1, 1971.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Beach Bear" >}} - A white bear who likes to surf and be cool.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Fatz Geronimo" >}} - A keyboard-playing gorilla from the Audobon Zoo forming the centerpiece of the band and the leader of the Colander Head Movement. Is self-aggrandizing and a philanderer with "potentially" a wife named {{< wiki-link "Esmerelda" >}}. Canonically wrote the 1984 Louisiana World's Fair Theme, which was in real life created by Fatz first voice actor- Burt Wilson.<sup>(1)</sup></li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Dook Larue" >}} - A brown dog drummer with an affinity for space. Portrayed as dim-witted during skits, but with a powerful singing voice during songs.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Rolfe Dewolfe" >}} - A gray ventriloquist wolf, being a former K-Mart lounge singer- now manager of the band, performs various skits with Earl on their stage- or comes out to harass the main band. He is greedy and selfish, believing he has a large fanclub that inflates his ego.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Earl Schmerle" >}} - A yellow muppet-looking sidekick to Rolfe as his ventriloquist dummy. Earl uses every opportunity to antagonize and demean Rolfe as his foil. He is treated as a real individual character that lives with Rolfe, implying Rolfe's personality on-stage isn't just an act for the audience.</li>
</ul>
The RAE also had a few prop characters with minor roles, being {{< wiki-link "Choo-Choo" >}} the baby black bear, a {{< wiki-link "Sun" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Moon" >}}, and the spider {{< wiki-link "Antioch" >}}.
<br>
Additionally, Rolfe & Earl have been rotated out of the cast on occasion to bring in new guest characters, such as {{< wiki-link "Santa Claus" >}} and the {{< wiki-link "Statue of Liberty (Animatronic)" >}}, and notably big-nosed human {{< wiki-link "Uncle Klunk" >}}. Klunk, atleast in his ShowBiz debut, was a goofy personality calling up various characters to bounce off of, alongside his bird Murray. The initial Creative Engineering take by Jeff Howell, as originally intended for the character, presented more as an awkward talk-show host- with a bird named Click.
<h2>History</h2>
The Rock-afire Explosion, taking combined elements and characters from their prior {{< wiki-link "Wolf Pack 5" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Hard Luck Bears" >}} shows, debuted at the {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}} ShowBiz Pizza Place on August 14th, 1980. Early iterations of the show had varying animatronic mechs, masks, accessories, clothing, props, painted elements, and more- but this would be refined throughout the first 4 years. The band would be given a new showtape every few months to play, usually consisting between 30 minutes to an hour of songs and skits. Additionally, all shows had the {{< wiki-link "3-Birthday Reel" >}}, which allowed birthday segments to be queued up at any time.
<br>
The showtapes for the first few years were mainly compilations of various skits and segments all unrelated to eachother. Each tape would combine new segments with ones from previous tapes, giving titles like {{< wiki-link "RAE Classic Hits" >}}, {{< wiki-link "12 Shows Special" >}}, and {{< wiki-link "Best of Rock-afire Explosion '82" >}} This would even culminate in test markets recieving a {{< wiki-link "Show Selector" >}} that let customers choose any skit in any order to play.
<br>
The first show to begin having segments extend into multiple parts would be {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza '82 Tape" >}} in Spring of 1982, having the "Feelings Skit", "Crying Skit", and "Satisfaction Medley" back to back. The {{< wiki-link "Spring Shows '82" >}} tape would then spread these across the runtime. {{< wiki-link "Tribute to Abbey Road" >}} would feature a much larger production with rented musicians, 3 original songs, children for backup vocals, and finishing with a 14-minute Abbey Road Medley. Mitzi would also be recast from Aaron Fechter, who played 5 other characters, to Shalisa Sloan, now having a proper female vocalist. 
<br>
The first fully-themed tape would be {{< wiki-link "RAE Christmas '82" >}}, which now also featured Rick Bailey as Beach Bear, again replacing Aaron, and switching his early personality of a goofball to being more laid back. Later that month the first 'live' showtape would debut as {{< wiki-link "New Years Eve Countdown '82'" >}}, which was set to play once at a specific time at all ShowBiz Pizza Place's to coincide with the New Years countdown.
