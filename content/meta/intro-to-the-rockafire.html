<center>Welcome to Cheese-E-Pedia! This introduction article will help you get started with the basics to venture into our {{< count-pages >}} articles.</center>
The <b><i>{{< wiki-link "Rock-afire Explosion" >}}</i></b> was an animatronic band created by {{< wiki-link "Creative Engineering" >}} for {{< wiki-link "ShowBiz Pizza Place" >}} restaurants in 1980, which continued at its locations until 1992- where they were retrofitted with {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese's" >}} characters as the new {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification Stage" >}}. The Rock-afire also appeared at family entertainment centers starting in the late 80's, and continue to be at various centres to this day.
<h2>Characters / Animatronics</h2>
The RAE consisted of a large cast of animated characters which have mostly stayed the same for its entire run:
<ul>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Billy Bob" >}} - A brown country bear with a sweet disposition and the main mascot of the Rock-afire through both ShowBiz and the RAE's future outings. Is best friends with Looney Bird.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Looney Bird" >}} - A silly red bird that lives in an oil drum. Initially started as a goofy drunk, but slowly became a "tech nerd bird" with interests in various technologies.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Mitzi Mozzarella" >}} - A gray cheerleader mouse depicted usually as a stereotypical teen girl. She is the only canonical character to age, being born January 1, 1971.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Beach Bear" >}} - A white bear who likes to surf and be cool.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Fatz Geronimo" >}} - A keyboard-playing gorilla from the Audobon Zoo forming the centerpiece of the band and the leader of the Colander Head Movement. Is self-aggrandizing and a philanderer with "potentially" a wife named {{< wiki-link "Esmerelda" >}}. Canonically wrote the 1984 Louisiana World's Fair Theme, which was in real life created by Fatz first voice actor- Burt Wilson.<sup>(1)</sup></li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Dook Larue" >}} - A brown dog drummer with an affinity for space. Portrayed as dim-witted during skits, but with a powerful singing voice during songs.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Rolfe Dewolfe" >}} - A gray ventriloquist wolf, being a former K-Mart lounge singer- now manager of the band, performs various skits with Earl on their stage- or comes out to harass the main band. He is greedy and selfish, believing he has a large fanclub that inflates his ego.</li>
    <li>{{< wiki-link "Earl Schmerle" >}} - A yellow muppet-looking sidekick to Rolfe as his ventriloquist dummy. Earl uses every opportunity to antagonize and demean Rolfe as his foil. He is treated as a real individual character that lives with Rolfe, implying Rolfe's personality on-stage isn't just an act for the audience.</li>
</ul>
The RAE also had a few prop characters with minor roles, being {{< wiki-link "Choo-Choo" >}} the baby black bear, a {{< wiki-link "Sun" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Moon" >}}, and the spider {{< wiki-link "Antioch" >}}.
<br>
Additionally, Rolfe & Earl have been rotated out of the cast on occasion to bring in new guest characters, such as {{< wiki-link "Santa Claus" >}} and the {{< wiki-link "Statue of Liberty (Animatronic)" >}}, and notably big-nosed human {{< wiki-link "Uncle Klunk" >}}. Klunk, atleast in his ShowBiz debut, was a goofy personality calling up various characters to bounce off of, alongside his bird Murray. The initial Creative Engineering take by Jeff Howell, as originally intended for the character, presented more as an awkward talk-show host- with a bird named Click.
